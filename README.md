# stopwatch_flutter

A simple Stowatch app, made using flutter. I made this project to learn about the "Timer" class and "InkWell" widget.

The UI is smooth and simple, to romnve all the laps just long-press the flag-button. To know about the functioning, refer the code in the "main.dart" file inside the "lib" folder.

To install the app, download the apk/ipa file.

Here are some screen shots of the app:
